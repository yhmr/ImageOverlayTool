**ImageOverlayTool** is a desktop application for overlaying and comparing multiple images with precision.
It supports developers' image verification work and design comparison tasks.

---

## 1. Installation

### Download

Get it from [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9PBQ7VPKTXQ1?cid=DevShareMCLPCS) or download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yhmr/ImageOverlayTool/releases).

- **Windows**: `.exe` or `.zip` file
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` or `.deb` file

### System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later / Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

---

## 2. Basic Operations

### Loading Images

There are four ways to load images:

1. **From file dialog**: Select "Image Settings" from the menu (or press `Ctrl+I`), then click the "Add" button to select files.
2. **Drag & Drop**: Drag and drop image files onto the main window or image settings window.
3. **Paste from clipboard**: Press `Ctrl+V` to paste an image from the clipboard (added as a temporary cache image).
4. **Launch Options & Scene Input**: You can pass file paths as arguments when launching the application to load them immediately. Additionally, by passing a `.scene.json` file, you can launch the app with an initial state that applies multiple images, layout information, and filter settings all at once.

### Manipulating Images

- **Move**: Drag an image to adjust its position.
- **Transform**: Drag the corner anchor points for perspective correction (free transform).
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the entire stage.

### Fit to Screen

Use "Fit to Screen" (`Ctrl+F`) from the menu to fit the selected image to the window size.

---

## 3. Image Settings Window

Open from the menu via "Image Settings" (`Ctrl+I`) or the FAB menu's settings button.

### Image List and Reordering

- A list of loaded images is displayed.
- Drag the grip handle (☰) to reorder layers by drag & drop.
- Click an image to select it; it will be highlighted on the main canvas.

### Transparency

Adjust each image's opacity (0–100%) with the slider. Making foreground images semi-transparent enables easy comparison with background images.

### Scale

Adjust the display scale of images with the slider.

### Rotation

Set the rotation angle of images using the slider or numeric input.

### Reset Transform

Click "Reset Transform" to restore the image's position, transformation, and rotation to their initial state.

### Image Filters

Click the "Filter" button to open a popover with the following filters:

- **Binarization**: Converts the image to black and white. Adjust the threshold (0–255) with a slider.
- **HSV Adjustment**: Individually adjust Hue (H: -180 to +180), Saturation (S: -100 to +100), and Value/Brightness (V: -100 to +100) with sliders.

### Visibility and Lock

- **Visibility** (👁 icon): Toggle image visibility. Hidden images remain in the layer list.
- **Lock** (🔒 icon): Locked images cannot be moved or transformed on the canvas, preventing accidental modifications.

### Relinking Missing Images

When opening an existing project with missing image files, a warning is displayed in the list. Use the "Relink" button to select a replacement file.

### Saving Clipboard Images

Images pasted from the clipboard (cache images) can be saved as regular files using the "Save As" button.

---

## 4. Project Management

Save and load your work as `.iot` project files.

| Action | Menu | Shortcut |

| Open Project | Menu > Open Project | `Ctrl+O` |
| Save Project | Menu > Save Project | `Ctrl+S` |
| Save As | Menu > Save As | `Ctrl+Shift+S` |

Project files store image paths, placement, transformation state, filter settings, layer order, and more.

## 5. Image Export & Capture

### Capture

Use "Capture" (`Ctrl+Shift+C`) from the menu to capture the desktop background and import it as an image.

### Image Export

Use "Image Export" (`Ctrl+E`) from the menu to export the current canvas state as an image file.
You can choose whether to include the background color in the export.

## 6. Dimension Lines

Open the dimension settings window from "Dimension Settings" (`Ctrl+D`) in the menu or from the FAB menu.
Draw dimension lines on the canvas with resolution-factor-aware real dimension display.

## 7. View Customization

### Background Color/Style

Change the canvas background color from "Background Style" (`Ctrl+B`) in the menu or the FAB menu's background style button. You can choose any color from the color picker, and frequently used colors can be saved and managed as presets.

### Always on Top

Toggle this from "Always on Top" in the menu or the FAB menu.
Click-through mode can be controlled only while this mode is ON.

### Click-Through Mode

Toggle via "Click-Through Mode" (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) in the menu or the FAB menu.
It can be enabled only when "Always on Top" is ON.
When using the global shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+M`, the app can enable "Always on Top" automatically and enter click-through mode in one step.
When enabled, clicks on the canvas area pass through to the window below (the menu bar and FAB buttons remain interactive).
A yellow indicator appears in the menu bar when active.
